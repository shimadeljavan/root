        <h2>Note: Repository Update</h2>
        <p>We'd like to inform you that our GitHub repository has been updated to enhance the overall project experience. While our repository accurately reflects 99% of our codebase, we've made a few minor refinements post-upload to streamline and improve the project.
</p>
        <p>Specifically, we've optimized the HTML files by reducing the number of Google Font families from two to one, reducing clutter and improving performance. Additionally, we've enriched our project report by incorporating a few additional images to provide a more comprehensive overview.</p>

            <h2>Task Ticker-Group Project: Living Report</h2>
            <h3>Group Members</h3>
            <p>Aysegul Aksu, Fransiskus Aldo, Shima Deljavan Farshi </p>
            <p>Working on Shima's project 03:Task Ticker</p>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The "Task Ticker-Group Project is a collaborative effort undertaken by the team of Aysegul Aksu, Fransiskus Aldo, and Shima Deljavan Farshi as part of the Dynamic Web Programming course. This project involves the development of a web application designed to assist users in managing their tasks efficiently.</p>
            <h2>Project Objective</h2>
            <h3>Database Integration</h3>
            <p>The primary objective of this project is to leverage relational database management techniques. The team has implemented two essential database tables, one for storing task data and the other for user information. This integration serves as a hands-on learning experience in the practical application of dynamic programming concepts.</p>
            <h3>Productivity Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Beyond its educational purpose, the project aims to offer practical utility to its target audience. The web application empowers users to create and manage their to-do lists effortlessly. By providing a platform to list tasks and monitor progress, the project seeks to enhance user productivity.</p>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>Our target audience comprises individuals who utilize online to-do list applications as a means of staying organized and enhancing productivity. They are people who value efficient task management and effective time utilization. However, it's important to acknowledge that having an extensive list of tasks can sometimes lead to stress and overwhelm.</p>
            <h3>Design Choices and Considerations</h3>
            <p>Our design choices were informed by the characteristics and preferences of our target audience.</p>
            <p>Font Selection: We opted for fonts that strike a balance between structure and readability. The use of 'Montserrat' and 'Poppins' conveys a sense of organization while ensuring content is easily readable. The wider look of these fonts prevents the page from feeling cramped.</p>
            <p>Color Palette: The color palette we selected consists of muted shades of yellow and green, with accents of red. These colors are strategically chosen to reflect different aspects of task management. Yellow signifies getting ready or preparing, green represents progress or completion (akin to a green light), and red serves as an alert or reminder. This combination creates a serene, yet alert environment.</p>
            <p>Logo Styling: We incorporated retro bold styling into the logo to add a touch of fun and playfulness to the overall design. This complements the structured and organized aspects of the application, creating a balanced user experience.</p>
            <h3>Gender Demographics</h3>
            <p>Research indicates that women are more likely to engage with note-taking, online calendars, and productivity apps compared to their male counterparts. Consequently, our target audience predominantly consists of women. To cater to this demographic, we incorporated design elements that resonate with feminine aesthetics.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Task Ticker web application is thoughtfully designed to meet the needs of a predominantly female target audience. Our design choices, including fonts, colors, and logo styling, aim to provide a structured yet visually appealing experience. By understanding the characteristics and preferences of our users, we ensure that Task Ticker is an efficient and stress-free tool for managing tasks and enhancing productivity.</p>
